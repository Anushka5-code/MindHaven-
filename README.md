# MindHaven-
A mental wellness sanctuary. Anonymous AI chatbot with empathetic support. Access resources, consultations, and community safely.

# Problem Statement 
Imagine you’re caught in the chaos of life, weighed down by stress and anxiety that leave you feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. You
want help but hesitate to seek in-person therapy—it feels too raw, too exposed. So, you turn to the internet, hoping for a quiet, safe space 
to find some comfort. But what you find falls flat: chatbots dish out cold, mechanical responses that don’t connect, and websites recycle
bland, generic advice that barely touches your struggles. You’re left feeling alone, like your emotions don’t matter, with no online space
that truly gets you or offers the support you need.
